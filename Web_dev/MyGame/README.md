# Role-Playing Game Web App 

This web application is designed to streamline and enhance the experience of playing a complex role-playing game. It includes several modules that support various game mechanics and make gameplay more intuitive.

## Features

1. **Role Assignment for Players**  
   The screen displays 10 face-down cards arranged randomly, each hiding a specific role. Players take turns selecting a card and memorizing their role. The app ensures that only one card can be opened at a time, and each card automatically disappears after a few seconds to prevent the next player from seeing the previous choice. All selected roles are recorded in the order they were assigned, and a summary table of the assigned roles can be generated at the end.

2. **Audio Playback**  
   The application features several sections for selecting and playing audio files. It includes playback controls such as pause, restart, reset, and a built-in timer to assist during the game.

3. **Random Number Generator**  
   A simple tool that generates random numbers from 1 to 10, allowing players to determine their seating order at the game table.

4. **Advanced Role Assignment (Casper Edition)**  
   An enhanced version of the role assignment module. All assigned roles are saved, and an interface is provided for players to verify another player's role when needed.

5. **Web-Based Game Log**  
   An interactive table designed for the game master to record game progress. It includes various fields for tracking actions and making notes throughout the session.

## Notes

This description focuses on the application's functionality and user interface, rather than the complex rules of the game itself. The main goal is to highlight how the application enhances the overall gameplay experience by making the role-playing process more organized and user-friendly.
